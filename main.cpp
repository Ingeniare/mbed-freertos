 * Creates all the demo application tasks, then starts the scheduler.  The WEB
 * documentation provides more details of the standard demo application tasks.
 * In addition to the standard demo tasks, the following tasks and tests are
 * defined and/or created within this file:
 *
 * "Check" hook -  This only executes every five seconds from the tick hook.
 * Its main function is to check that all the standard demo tasks are still 
 * operational.  Should any unexpected behaviour within a demo task be discovered 
 * the tick hook will write an error to the LCD (via the LCD task).  If all the 
 * demo tasks are executing with their expected behaviour then the check task 
 * writes PASS to the LCD (again via the LCD task), as described above.
 *
 * "uIP" task -  This is the task that handles the uIP stack.  All TCP/IP
 * processing is performed in this task.
