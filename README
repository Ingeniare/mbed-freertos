Ripped and mixed from FreeRTOS 6.0.4 by Hugo Vincent.

www.freertos.org

Tested with the Codesourcery 2009q3-68 arm-non-eabi toolchain, built from
source with http://github.com/hugovincent/arm-eabi-toolchain (on Mac OS X 10.6)

IMPORTANT NOTE: this is for mbed beta program hardware, which used the
LPC2368 instead of the newer LPC1768. I intend to port this to support both 
mbed processors as soon as I get new hardware to test with.
