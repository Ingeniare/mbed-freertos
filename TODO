Last Update: 25 May 2010.

Numbers in [ ] are priorities, 'f' is "distant future", 'd' is "done but pending".

BUGS:
[1] Check/fix __attribute__ ((packed)) usage for structs where alignment matters.
[1] Finish factoring crt0 code into core-specific and common parts.
[1] Fix KEEP() in linker script wrt ctors/dtors. Fix (any) remaining alignment issues in linker script.
[1] Try to avoid duplicating what http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~pcc/MCP/index.html are doing.
[2] Ensure debug output printed by abort traps is actually correct (hmmm?).
[2] Refactor UART code to support all 4 UARTs.
[2] Optimize UART code (maybe a ring buffer would be better?).
[2] Test/fix/finish the syscalls interface. Fix reentrancy.
[3] Fix/finish the uSTL integration.
[f] Test/fix ethernet code.

GENERALIZATIONS:
[1] Provide bootcode support for LPC1768-based mbed devices.
[1] All application-level APIs should work identically on either mbed processor type.
[2] Finish GPIO driver.
[2] Integrate CMSIS-style SystemInit(), NVIC_SetVector() and clock idioms.
[2] FreeRTOS only provides a kernel. We need to supply the rest of the OS.
		Filesystem.
		File-like objects for peripherals as in UNIX.
		Debug support (ideally a GDB server/monitor of some kind).
[2] All the peripheral drivers should be C++-ified and made as API-compatible
    with mbed standard library as is possible and desirable within the context
    of an RTOS.
[f] Investigate running everything in USR mode instead of SVC.
[f] Fractional baud rate code is inefficient and takes up a bunch of storage.

ADDITIONS:
[1] Add more standard library and syscall niceities.
[2] Add gdb-stubs for remote debug over serial port.
[3] Add mbed local file system support and integrate with newlib. Some details here:

		http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/elua/trunk/src/?op=log&rev=0&sc=0&isdir=1
[3] Integrate PicoC for scripting. 
[f] Integrate some nice DSP libraries.

[d] ADC.
[1] PWM.
[2] RTC.
[3] USB device with CDC virtual serial port.
