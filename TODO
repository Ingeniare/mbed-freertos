Last Update: 1 August 2010.

Numbers in [ ] are priorities, 'f' is "distant future", 'd' is "done but pending".

BUGS:
[1] fd allocation in SemiFS and RomFS is broken and should be done by device_manager.
[1] Enable <dirent.h> in Newlib toolchain configuration and reenabled dirent-related
    functions in semifs, add to romfs and device manager.
[1] Finish factoring crt0 code into core-specific and common parts.
[2] Refactor UART code to support all 4 UARTs.
[2] Optimize UART code (maybe a ring buffer would be better?).
[3] Fix/finish the uSTL integration.
[f] Test/fix ethernet & webserver code. Integrate local FS with webserver instead of 
    uIP's built in httpd-fs stuff.

GENERALIZATIONS:
[1] Thread-local memory. Finish dynamic reentrancy in syscalls.
[1] Figure out protected-mode driver access model and syscalls via SVC/SWI?
[1] Refactor to consistently use CMSIS api naming.
[2] Finish GPIO driver.
[f] Fractional baud rate code is inefficient and takes up a bunch of storage.

ADDITIONS:
[1] POSIX wrappers for threading, sockets, etc.
[1] Allow particular tasks to register for ISRs and have the kernel mediate access to vectors.
[2] Add gdb-stubs for remote debug over serial port.
[3] Integrate PicoC for scripting. 
[f] Integrate some nice DSP libraries.

ON-CHIP PERIPHERAL DRIVERS:
[d] I2C master (all 3 buses).
[d] SPI master.
[d] ADC.
[1] PWM.
[2] RTC.
[3] USB device with CDC virtual serial port.
[3] DAC.
[3] 1-Wire master.
[f] CAN.
[f] SD/MMC Controller.
[f] USB host/OTG.
[f] Other uses of USB device besides CDC virtual serial.
[f] Generalised SSP besides SPI.
[f] I2S/audio

EXTERNAL DEVICE DRIVERS:
[d] Intersil ISL9208 multicell lithium battery analog front end (via I2C).
[d] DS2745 battery monitor (via I2C). 
[1] Linear LTC1960 lithium battery charger and powerpath controller (via SPI).
[1] Temperature sensors (TBD) (via I2C or maybe 1-wire, TBD).

THINGS TO CHECK:
[1] Stack overflow checker needs checking.
[2] Ensure debug output printed by abort traps is actually correct (hmmm?).
[f] Investigate running everything in USR mode instead of SVC on ARM7.
