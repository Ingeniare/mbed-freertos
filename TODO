Last Update: 7 August 2010.

Numbers in [ ] are priorities, 'f' is "distant future", 'd' is "done but pending".

BUGS:
[1] fd allocation in SemiFS and RomFS is broken and should be done by device_manager.
[1] Fix dirent.h and enable dirent-related functions in semifs, add to romfs and device manager.
[1] Enable _POSIX_TIMERS, _POSIX_MONOTONIC_CLOCK, gettimeofday etc and HAVE_GETDATE in Newlib.
[2] Refactor UART code to support all 4 UARTs.
[2] Optimize UART code (maybe a ring buffer would be better?).
[3] Fix/finish the uSTL integration.
[2] Exception handlers on ARM7 are currently broken.
[3] Check and fix new stack backtrace code based on libgcc _Unwind.
[f] Test/fix ethernet & webserver code. Integrate local FS with webserver instead of 
    uIP's built in httpd-fs stuff.

GENERALIZATIONS:
[1] Finish RTC time integration.
[1] Standardized debug/log messages system.
[1] Buffered, multiplexed standard IO (console). "Early stdout init" for debugging.
[1] Thread-local memory. Finish dynamic reentrancy in syscalls.
[1] Figure out protected-mode driver access model and syscalls via SVC/SWI?
[1] Switch over to the lwIP stack instead of uIP.
[2] RomFS should be FlashFS, with IAP.
[2] Finish GPIO driver.
[f] Fractional baud rate code is inefficient and takes up a bunch of storage.

ADDITIONS:
[1] POSIX wrappers for threading, sockets, timers, date/time etc.
[1] Standardized, kernel-mediated interrupt API for drivers.
[1] Standardized user-process-level signal-based interrupt abstraction.
[1] Standardized DMA api.
[1] Writes to console stdout should be prefixed with task name.
[2] Configuration management system.
[2] Interactive shell over serial console.
[2] Add gdb-stubs for remote debug over serial port.
[2] Add symbol table so backtrace etc can show symbols instead of addresses.
[3] Idle-load based dynamic frequency scaling.
[3] Integrate FatFS filesystem support.
[3] Integrate PicoC for scripting. 
[f] Integrate some nice DSP libraries.

DRIVERS:
  On-Chip:
	[d] I2C master (all 3 buses).
	[d] SPI master.
	[d] ADC.
	[1] PWM.
	[2] SD/MMC Controller.
	[3] USB device with CDC virtual serial port.
	[3] DAC.
	[3] 1-Wire master.
	[f] CAN.
	[f] USB host/OTG.
	[f] Other uses of USB device besides CDC virtual serial.
	[f] Generalised SSP besides SPI.
	[f] I2S/audio
  External devices:
	[d] Intersil ISL9208 multicell lithium battery analog front end (via I2C).
	[d] DS2745 battery monitor (via I2C). 
	[3] Linear LTC1960 lithium battery charger and powerpath controller (via SPI).
	[3] Linear LTC6802 lithium battery AFE (via SPI-like-bus) 

THINGS TO CHECK:
[1] Stack overflow checker needs checking.
[2] Ensure debug output printed by abort traps is actually correct (hmmm?).
[f] Investigate running everything in USR mode instead of SVC on ARM7.
